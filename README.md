## styles

### hn\_dark

Originally from [Dark Hacker News - Solarized](https://userstyles.org/styles/92693/dark-hacker-news-solarized), licensed as public domain.

I've modified it to tweak some colors and make comments have higher contrast

### github\_dark

Originally from [StylishThemes - GitHub Dark](https://userstyles.org/styles/37035/github-dark), licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0.

Thus far, unmodified except for passing it through cssfmt.

### facebook

Super minimal style, just hides the right-bar and makes the center full-width to use up the blank space created there.

## Adding a style

Create a css file and run `make` to format it with [cssfmt](https://github.com/morishitter/cssfmt). You'll need to have cssfmt installed, which you can do with `npm install -g cssfmt`.
